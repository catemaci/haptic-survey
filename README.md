# Haptic Experience Study

This repository contains a web-based survey platform developed for a Master's thesis in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, in collaboration with Inria and the Rainbow Team.

## Overview

The study investigates how users perceive physical and emotional properties of materials in everyday objects.

Participants evaluate a series of case studies using continuous sliders (0–1 scale) across multiple dimensions, including:

- Roughness

- Sharpness
- Valence
- Arousal

The platform includes:
- Multilingual support (EN / IT / FR)
- Background information collection
- Definitions section for all evaluated dimensions
- Randomized case order
- Mandatory responses validation
- Data collection via Google Apps Script to Google Sheets
